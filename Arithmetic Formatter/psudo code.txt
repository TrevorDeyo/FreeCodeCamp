check if theres more then 5 items in the list - 'Error: Too many problems.'

check if only add and subtract "Error: Operator must be '+' or '-'."

check if each number only has digits 'Error: Numbers must only contain digits.'

check if more then 4 digits 'Error: Numbers cannot be more than four digits.'

go problem by problem

split each problem up into its componets 

determine the length of the longest number

format each row

had a problem with spaces on the end for awhile thankfully rstrip 
saved the day, don't wanna admit how long it took me to remember that

stack the rows

if true was passed then include answer row

If the user supplied the correct format of problems, the conversion you
return will follow these rules:

There should be a single space between the operator and the longest of
the two operands, the operator will be on the same line as the second
operand, both operands will be in the same order as provided (the
first will be the top one and the second will be the bottom).

Numbers should be right-aligned.

There should be four spaces between each problem.

There should be dashes at the bottom of each problem. The dashes should run
along the entire length of each problem individually.
